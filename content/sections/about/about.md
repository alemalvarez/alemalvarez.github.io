#### Where I come from?

As I was unsure on what degree to choose, I decided to play it safe and pursue both an Engineering degree and a Business one, and eventually find my path. Three universities and four years later, I finally know: **Deep Learning**.

#### Where I'm going?

I genuinely believe that AI, and specially Neural Networks have the potential to make the world a better place, and I'm here for that. I plan to pursue a **MsC in cognitive science / applied math / scientific computation**. I want to live the bleeding edge of DL research!
