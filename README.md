This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website, built with the lovely static site generator [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and deployed using the [`gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) Node package. 🚀

## About 📚

My portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. It's built with Gatsby, a blazing-fast React-based framework that generates static websites for optimal performance and security. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible and shareable.<br>
This readme was, of course, written by Anthropic's Claude Opus ;)

## Suggestions and Contributions 🤝

I'm always open to suggestions and contributions from the community! If you have any ideas for improving the website, whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing the overall user experience, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. Let's make this portfolio website even better together! 🌟
